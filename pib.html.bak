<h2> Particle in a Box </h2>
<h3> Because sometimes, you need to be clear about your boundaries...</h3>

<h3> Free Particle...</h3>
<p>First, we can begin by considering a particle, like an electron for example,
to be in an unconstrained 1D space. In order for the particle to be unconstrained,
the potential energy is given to be 0 at all points in our 1-dimentional space.
Thus the hamiltonian only includes the kinetic energy term, meaning that our
solution to Schrodinger's Equation must be some function whose second derivative
is itself times a constant. Thus we conclude that the wavefunction is a sine
function, with the form Asin(kx).</p>

<h3> Particle in a 1D box...</h3>
<p>Next, we consider a particle constrained to exist in a certain region of space
, which we refer to as the "box." Inside the box, the potential energy is 0 so that
the particle is free to move in this region. Outside the box, the potential energy
is infinity, such that the particle will never exist there. This restraint gives our
Schrodinger Equation new boundary conditions, thus our wavefunction will likewise be
different. The solution ends up being <i> quantized</i>, meaning that the energy of the
particle in the box can only be certain discrete values, and not values in between!
This "quantization" is where we get the name "Quantum Mechanics" from :) </p>

<h3> Particles in boxes of higher dimensions...</h3>
<p> For particles in boxes of higher dimensions, we have a similar picture in each direction
as we have for the 1D case. We find that the wavefunction is the product of 1D eigenfunctions, 
while the energy is the summation of the eigenvalues.
