<h2> Harmonic Oscillator </h2>
<h3> Everything is oscillating if you look close enough...</h3>

<h3> 1D Harmonic oscillator... </h3>
<p> If we instead want to model the vibration of a subatomic particle, we use the quantum analog of 
a mass on a string, the harmonic oscillator. In this model, instead of having potential 
energies equal to 0 or infinity, we consider the potential energy to be of the form
of the spring potential energy in classical mechanics, namely V(x)=<span>&#189;</span>kx<span>&#178;</span></p>

<h3> Quantum tunneling... </h3>
<p>One cool result that comes from this model is that the solution of the Schrodinger Equation
leads to a fascinating result: particles can be found in a region that classical
mechanics forbids! This phenomenom is know as quantum tunneling, and it basically
means that a particle can propogate through potential barries. This is equivalent
to a human being able to walk through a wall! </p>
