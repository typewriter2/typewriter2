<h3> A brief history... </h3>
<p>The beginning of quantum mechanics was in the early 20th century. At that time, many physicists were realizing 
that very small objects, specifically those on the subatomic scale, did not behave the way that macroscopic ones
did. Macroscopic objects have been observed to follow Newton's Laws, but light and electrons were found to act in 
some wackcy ways. Specifically, it was found that light acts like a particle (called a photon!) and electrons act
like a wave. Even crazier than that-it was found by DeBroglie that all masses behave as a wave! Even a bowling
ball has a wavelength, its just so tiny that you can't observe any of its effects.

<h3> Linear algebra makes a comeback... </h3>
<p> If you don't know linear algebra, don't fear. You just need to 
know some basics! Probably the most important of which are eigenvalues and eigenfunctions
, which comes from understanding operators. Briefly, operators are any kind of function acting
on a function. E.g. the "position" operator x&#770; in quantum mechanics, simply multiplies
the position, x, by the function its acting on. So for a general operator Ã‚, if we act
 that operator on a function, and it returns the same function times some constant, then the 
 function is called an <i> eigenfunction </i> and the constant is called an <i> eigenvalue </i>.
If you get this pretty tricky concept down, you're ready to go!
